Power Required (at the plasma) to support rotation 85.2 kW
	 Power Loss from viscous torque  10.4 kW
	 Power Loss from parallel loss   9.42 kW
	 Power Loss from charge exchange 65.4 kW

Total Stored Energy is 4.69 kJ
 of which 3.79 kJ is kinetic energy in the rotation
      and 906 J is thermal energy of the plasma
Energy Confinement Time is 87.2 ms
Of which
	Confinement time from parallel losses is	181 ms
	Confinement time from perpendicular losses is	164 ms
	Confinement time from charge-exchange losses is	116 ms

Particle (Ion) Confinement Time ~= 100 ms

Ion-Electron Temperature Equilibration Time is 41.8 ms

Plasma must be provided at a rate of 2.52e+18 electrons /s to maintain steady-state

Neutral gas must be provided at a rate of 2.52e+18 particles/s to refuel the plasma
This leads to a steady-state neutral density of 8.86e+13/m^3
The level of charge-exchange losses due to the neutrals is 1.63e+19 particles/s lost
	 This is equivalent to a heat loss rate of 2.61 kW
